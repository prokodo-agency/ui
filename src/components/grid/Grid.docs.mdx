# Grid

Layout utility components (`Grid` and `GridRow`) for building responsive grid layouts. Based on CSS Grid with design-system column tokens.

## When to use

Use `Grid` and `GridRow` to arrange sibling components into a column-based layout that adapts to different screen sizes. Prefer Grid over custom CSS Grid or Flexbox when the layout must follow the design system's column grid.

## Components

| Component | Purpose                                                             |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Grid`    | Outer grid container — sets column count and gap                    |
| `GridRow` | Single row inside the grid — configures column spans per breakpoint |

## Accessibility (WCAG 2.2)

- Grid renders a plain `<div>` container — no semantics are added or removed
- Ensure the reading order in the DOM matches the visual order for keyboard and screen-reader users
- Do not use Grid to reorder content visually while keeping a different DOM order

## ✅ Do

- Use only within the established design-system layout boundaries
- Define responsive column spans at the `GridRow` level for each breakpoint
- Test at all target breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop)

## ❌ Don't

- Don't use Grid for micro-layout within a component (use Flexbox or component-level CSS)
- Don't nest Grid containers more than two levels deep
- Don't rely on visual order for focus order — keep DOM order meaningful

## Examples

### Default (three columns)

<Canvas of={GridStories.Default} />

### Two columns

<Canvas of={GridStories.TwoColumns} />

### Four columns (responsive)

<Canvas of={GridStories.FourColumns} />

### Centred row

<Canvas of={GridStories.CenteredRow} />

### No gap

<Canvas of={GridStories.NoGap} />

### Props

<Controls of={GridStories.Default} />
