# PostWidget

A sidebar or inline content widget presenting a curated list of posts as compact cards. Supports a full-width layout variant and optional structured-data injection.

## When to use

Use `PostWidget` in sidebar areas, article bottoms ("Related posts"), and landing page sections where a condensed list of posts should appear as a cohesive card group.

## Accessibility (WCAG 2.2)

- The widget title acts as an implicit `<h>` landmark; set the heading level to match document outline
- Each post item link has a unique accessible name (the post title)
- Structured data (`structuredData`) is rendered as non-interactive `<script>` and does not impact keyboard navigation

## ✅ Do

- Provide at least two `items` so the widget reads as a list
- Use `fullWidth` only when the widget spans the full content column

## ❌ Don't

- Don't reuse the same link text for different posts within one widget
- Don't nest `PostWidget` inside another card without adequate visual separation

## Examples

### Full width
