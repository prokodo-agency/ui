# PostTeaser

A featured blog-post card displaying a hero image, headline, excerpt, reading time, publish date, and structured SEO metadata. Used in listing pages and editorial feeds.

## When to use

Use `PostTeaser` as the primary card for editorial content previews in a grid or feed layout. For compact list rows use `PostItem`; for a sidebar summary widget use `PostWidget`.

## Accessibility (WCAG 2.2)

- The headline link has a unique, descriptive accessible name that matches the post title
- Reading time and publish date are surfaced in `<time>` elements
- Structured data (`structuredData`) is injected via a `<script type="application/ld+json">` and does not affect DOM focus

## ✅ Do

- Always provide `locale` so dates are formatted in the reader's language
- Include `structuredData` for SEO-rich snippets in search results

## ❌ Don't

- Don't omit the hero image alt text — it is a primary visual anchor
- Don't render more than one `PostTeaser` per row on mobile without a responsive grid
