# ImageText

Two-column layout combining an image and text content side by side. Used for feature sections, service descriptions, and editorial hero blocks.

## When to use

Use `ImageText` for marketing or editorial sections that pair a visual with explanatory copy and an optional call-to-action. Prefer this over hand-rolled two-column layouts for consistency.

## Layout

- Default: image on the left, text on the right
- `reverse={true}`: image on the right, text on the left
- Stacks vertically on mobile

## Accessibility (WCAG 2.2)

- The image `alt` text must describe the visual content (not the article topic)
- CTA button/link must have a descriptive label — avoid "Click here" or "Read more" alone
- Maintain logical heading hierarchy: `subTitle` renders before `title`, both anchored to surrounding page structure

## ✅ Do

- Keep `title` and `content` concise for above-the-fold usage
- Use `reverse` to alternate layout direction in list-of-features sections
- Provide `button.href` for the CTA whenever possible so it is accessible as a native link

## ❌ Don't

- Don't use as a full-page layout wrapper — embed inside a page section
- Don't use an decorative image without setting `alt=""`
- Don't use both `subTitle` and a section heading at the same level above this component
