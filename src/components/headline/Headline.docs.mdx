# Headline

Semantic heading component mapping heading levels to design-system typography variants. Decouples visual style from HTML element to keep the DOM hierarchy meaningful for accessibility.

## When to use

Use `Headline` for every heading in the product — page titles, section headings, card headers, and widget titles. Never use raw `<h1>`–`<h6>` elements or utility classes for headings outside of this component.

## Variants vs. levels

`variant` controls the **visual** size/style (`h1`–`h6`, `subtitle1`, `subtitle2`, etc.).  
`tag` controls the **semantic** HTML element rendered in the DOM.

Always choose a `tag` that reflects the correct document outline, independent of how large the heading looks visually.

## Accessibility (WCAG 2.2)

- Renders the correct `<h1>`–`<h6>` element for screen readers and landmark navigation
- Do not skip heading levels in the document outline (e.g. `h1` → `h3`)
- Use only one `h1` per page
- `ariaLabel` provides an accessible name override when the visible text is insufficient

## ✅ Do

- Keep heading text concise and descriptive
- Maintain a logical heading hierarchy on every page
- Use `variant` to match the design specification while keeping `tag` semantically correct

## ❌ Don't

- Don't use `Headline` purely for font size — use `Typography` or CSS instead
- Don't use `h1` for decorative/marketing slogans that are not meaningful headings
- Don't duplicate `h1` within a page
