# Stepper

A step-by-step wizard that guides the user through a sequential multi-stage process. Each step has a label, optional icon, and can carry a completion or error state.

## When to use

Use `Stepper` for multi-page forms, onboarding flows, and checkout sequences where each stage must be completed in order and progress needs to be visible. For independent sections use `Tabs`.

## Accessibility (WCAG 2.2)

- The step list has `role="list"` with each step as `role="listitem"`
- The current step is communicated via `aria-current="step"`
- Completed steps have `aria-label="[Step name] – completed"`
- Navigation buttons (`Next`, `Back`) are standard `<button>` elements with descriptive labels

### Keyboard behavior

- **Tab**: navigate between the action buttons
- **Enter / Space**: activate the focused button
- Navigation through locked future steps is prevented

## ✅ Do

- Display a persistent summary of completed data so users can verify before the final step
- Allow users to go back to earlier steps to correct mistakes

## ❌ Don't

- Don't split a single form field across multiple stepper steps — keep related fields together
- Don't use more than seven steps — beyond that, reconsider the information architecture
