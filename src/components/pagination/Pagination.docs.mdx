# Pagination

Navigation controls for paginated content lists. Renders page number buttons, previous/next arrows, and an optional items-per-page selector.

## When to use

Use `Pagination` below any list or grid that loads data in pages. For infinite-scroll patterns use a "Load more" button with `Loading` instead.

## Accessibility (WCAG 2.2)

- The pagination `<nav>` carries `aria-label="Pagination"` (or equivalent)
- The current page button carries `aria-current="page"`
- Previous/next buttons are disabled (not hidden) when at the boundary
- All page buttons have accessible labels ("Page 1", "Next page", etc.)
- Focus is managed after page change to announce the new state

### Keyboard behavior

- **Tab**: move between page buttons
- **Enter / Space**: activate the focused page button

## ✅ Do

- Always show the total number of pages or items when known
- Disable (not hide) previous/next at the boundaries
- Use ellipsis (`…`) for large page ranges with an accessible label

## ❌ Don't

- Don't use Pagination for sequential steps — use `Stepper`
- Don't remove visited page indicators when the user navigates back
- Don't reset focus to the top of the page on every page change
