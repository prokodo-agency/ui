# Teaser

A marketing card combining an image, headline, body copy, and a CTA redirect link. Supports an `animated` entrance variant for scroll-triggered reveals.

## When to use

Use `Teaser` on landing pages, service overview sections, and promotional areas where a visually rich card must communicate a value proposition and drive a click-through action.

## Accessibility (WCAG 2.2)

- The redirect link wraps or is associated with the card headline for a clear accessible name
- Image `alt` text describes the subject, not the design ("Two colleagues reviewing analytics" rather than "Marketing image")
- The animated entrance is a CSS transform — it respects `prefers-reduced-motion`; at reduced-motion the card is shown immediately without animation

## ✅ Do

- Keep the headline under ten words so it reads as a scannable title
- Ensure the CTA redirect target is meaningful when read out of context ("Learn more about SEO services", not just "Learn more")

## ❌ Don't

- Don't stack more than four Teasers in a single row — readability degrades
- Don't auto-play the entrance animation on repeat (e.g. on tab re-focus)
