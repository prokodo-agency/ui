# AnimatedText

Character-by-character typing-effect text reveal component.

## When to use

Use `AnimatedText` for hero taglines, loading placeholders, or anywhere a typewriter reveal adds engagement without overwhelming the user.

## Accessibility (WCAG 2.2)

`AnimatedText` keeps full content available to assistive technology:

- the complete text string is present in the DOM immediately via `aria-label`
- visual reveal is purely cosmetic — screen readers announce the full text at once
- respects `prefers-reduced-motion`: when reduced motion is preferred, the full text renders without animation

### Keyboard behavior

No interactive elements — `AnimatedText` is a presentational `<span>`. Focus order is unaffected.

## API notes

- `children` must be a plain string (not `ReactNode`)
- `delay` (ms) sets the pause before the first character appears
- `speed` (ms per character) controls typing tempo — lower is faster
- `disabled` renders the full string immediately with no animation

## ✅ Do

- Keep strings short (< 80 characters) for readable animation
- Use `delay` when the component mounts before the user's attention arrives
- Combine with `Animated` for entrance + typing double effect

## ❌ Don't

- Don't animate critical body text or instructions — animation slows reading
- Don't pass `ReactNode` as children; only plain strings are supported
- Don't use very low `speed` (< 10 ms) — it reads faster than users can follow
