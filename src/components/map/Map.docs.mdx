# Map

Embeds an interactive or static map (e.g. Google Maps, Mapbox) as a configurable component. Used for location-based content such as contact pages, store finders, and event detail pages.

## When to use

Use `Map` when you need to display a geographic location or route. For decorative map graphics use `Image` instead.

## Accessibility (WCAG 2.2)

- Always provide a text alternative for the map location (address, description) near the component
- The `<iframe>` or canvas element must have a meaningful `title` attribute
- Interactive map controls must be keyboard accessible
- Color contrast of map overlays and annotations must meet 3:1 ratio (WCAG 1.4.11)
- Provide a fallback link to an external map service for users who cannot interact with the embedded map

## ✅ Do

- Include a plain-text address alongside the map for users who cannot view it
- Set a descriptive `title` so screen readers announce the map context
- Lazy-load the map to avoid blocking page render

## ❌ Don't

- Don't rely solely on the map to communicate location — always include a text address
- Don't embed maps in modals without explicit scroll-lock handling
- Don't autoload heavy map SDKs on pages where the map is below the fold

## Examples
