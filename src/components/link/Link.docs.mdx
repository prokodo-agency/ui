# Link

Themed anchor/navigation link component. Wraps Next.js `Link` with design-system typography, color variants, and island architecture support for client-side navigation.

## When to use

Use `Link` for inline text links within prose, navigation lists, and CTAs where a button is semantically incorrect. For primary actions use `Button`.

## Accessibility (WCAG 2.2)

- Renders a native `<a>` element — fully keyboard and screen-reader accessible
- `aria-label` overrides the visible text for screen readers when needed
- `rel="noopener noreferrer"` is applied automatically for external links
- Meaningful link text: describe the destination, not the action ("View pricing" not "Click here")

## ✅ Do

- Use descriptive link text that makes sense out of context (screen reader list view)
- Set `external` or `target="_blank"` for links that open in a new tab and inform users
- Use `variant` to align the link color with its surrounding context

## ❌ Don't

- Don't use `Link` to trigger JavaScript actions — use `Button` with `variant="text"`
- Don't use vague text like "here", "click here", or "read more" without surrounding context
- Don't open links in a new tab without warning
