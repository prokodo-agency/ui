# Quote

A styled blockquote for pull quotes, testimonials, and editorial callouts. Optionally includes an author attribution line, an avatar image, and a title.

## When to use

Use `Quote` to highlight a significant statement from an article, case study, or customer testimonial. For inline citations use a standard `<blockquote>` element.

## Accessibility (WCAG 2.2)

- Content is rendered inside `<blockquote cite="…">` when a source URL is known
- Author attribution uses `<cite>` for semantic meaning
- Avatar images have meaningful `alt` text (author name) or `alt=""` when purely decorative

## ✅ Do

- Attribute every quote to a real author or source
- Keep quote text under ~200 characters for readability at display sizes

## ❌ Don't

- Don't use `Quote` for long body passages — use standard prose or a callout box
- Don't omit author attribution in customer-testimonial contexts where trust is critical
